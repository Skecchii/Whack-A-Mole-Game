# Problems

One major issue I had was adding a retry button incase players wanted to try again if the game is still running, and although it worked for the most part the timer and moles would break by counting and appearing faster then they should be. I made do with just removing it and adding at the end of the game to a play again button. There are still some features I want to add so overtime I would be coming back to this project to add them.
